## Requirements
 - As lightweight as possible
 - No tracking whatsoever
 - Opensource

## TODO
 - [x] Implements an input that can accept several ORBS IDs (currently up to 10)
 - [x] Display several orbs so there is never an empty slot 
 - [ ] Propose several layouts
 - [ ] Display friendly errors (wrong id, etc)
 - [ ] Store orbs IDs in URL (easier to save a custom selection)
 - [ ] Close orbs when pressing escape key (2 solutions: [a: autoplay orbs+super overlay], [b: setInterval to refocus on input field after submit])
 - [x] Dynamically resize the orbs on browsers resize
